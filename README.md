<h2> 1.1 Purpose </h2>

The project will be focused on creating an <a href="https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides">interactive p1xt guide</a>, with user submitted hints, suggestions, routes, and the ability to curate and develop quizzes for those wishing
to follow the study plan.

Team is currently focused on learning React. The necessary resources are listed in our stack channel.

Our readme will be developed in accordance with our development cycle, and it will hopefully reflect all changes of scope and functionality as we continue.

All commits will be pushed to development, with hopefully at least one reviewer.
